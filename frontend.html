                     <h3>A standard feature at the front end of a website, when it comes to the best front end development language, you should look no further than the inclusion of HTML. 
         
                         HTML is short for Hyper Text Markup Language and is a standard markup language added when creating web pages for your site. This language is the structure of the page and will consist of a series of different elements to show the intended structure of the page. Without this element with the structure, the browser would be unsure and unable to display the content correctly. An example of HTML would be <H>10 Best Front End Development Languages To Develop Your Website </H>. This tells the browser that the text is the title and to present it as such. 
                         
                         A basic front end development language, HTML should be viewed as a building block when it comes to the creation of web pages. Along with the creation of content and layout of the page, HTML tags can also be used to add visuals onto a page for the benefit of the viewer. </h3>

                     <br>
                     <h3>Another popular programming language and staple addition to the front development of your website is CSS. Short for Cascading Style Sheets, when programmed into the running of your site, CSS can describe how the HTML elements on the site are displayed and presented onto the screen. 
         
                         Controlling and presenting the page as intended by the developer the inclusion of CSS can save and reduce the amount of work. This can be done by controlling the layout of multiple web pages all at one time. 
                         
                         Super simple not just to add, but also to code, without this addition you will be unable to personalize and style web pages. CSS can alter the appearance of colors, spacing, and fonts to the appearance of a web page. Embed images and video, as well as other media, and the addition of headlines and paragraphs. Without CSS the aesthetic choices on hand to personalize your website would be limited. 
                         
                         To implement CSS to the front end of your site, you are fortunate and require little more than a text editor. With many different sites available and programs to help you write this language, finding software for you should be a piece of cake. </h3>

                         Allowing users to create dynamic pages, sites that are built using React are typically faster and can switch between different elements smoothly and swiftly. 
                         
                         If the user experience is at the top of your priority list, then consider React through the user friendly elements and the speed and functionality of the pages. Simple to use, React is also compatible with most back end setups.

This can allow you the web designer to edit and design separate parts separately with ease. </h3>
